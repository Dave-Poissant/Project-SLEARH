ASSEMBLY OF THE HAND

1. Start by opening the BOM file in this folder.
2. With a 3D printer at 40% fill and supports, print all the parts that have &quot;3D printed&quot; as a link. Some parts need to be printed more than once, refer to the quantity column of the BOM to know how many.
3. Make sure you have at your disposition all the fasteners needed for the assembly. The specs and the quantity needed are given in the BOM. If you need to buy anything, there is a McMaster link for each part.
4. Separate all the printed parts for each of the fingers where each number is the index in the BOM;

Pinky: 4 – 1 – 12 – 7

Ring finger: 4 – 1 – 12 – 3

Middle finger: 4 – 1 – 12 – 5

Index finger: 4 – 1 – 12 – 3

Thumb: 8 – 9 – 10 – 11 – 27 - 28

1. For the pinky, attach the two phalanxes together at the joint with the bolt of index 17 and the nut of index 19.
2. Assemble a servomotor to the servosocket with the fasteners 24. Make sure the wires are towards the hand.
3. Install the second lever arm on the servomotor with the bolt of index 15 and the nut of index 16. Make sure the curve of the rod is toward the back of the finger, that the head of the bolt is toward the servomotor and that you use the small hole of the rod.
4. Attach the other end of the rod to the last phalanx with the bolt of index 18 and the nut of index 19.
5. Attach the first lever arm of index 1 on the small arm of the first phalanx with the bolt of index 18 and the nut of index 19. Make sure the rod is towards the outside of the phalanx, that you use the bigger hole of the rod and that the curve is towards the back of the finger.
6. Repeat the steps 5-9 for each of the other fingers except for the thumb.
7. For the thumb, attach the two last phalanxes together at the joint with the bolt of index 17 and the nut of index 19.
8. Assemble a servomotor to the two servosockets of the thumb with the fasteners 24. Make sure the wires are towards the hand.
9. Install the third lever arm on the servomotor of the second servosocket with the bolt of index 15 and the nut of index 16. Make sure the curve of the rod is toward the back of the finger, that the head of the bolt is toward the servomotor and that you use the small hole of the rod.
10. Attach the other end of the rod to the last phalanx with the bolt of index 18 and the nut of index 19.
11. Install the second lever arm on the servomotor of the first servosocket with the bolt of index 15 and the nut of index 16. Make sure the curve of the rod is toward the back of the finger, that the head of the bolt is toward the servomotor and that you use the small hole of the rod.
12. Attach the other end of the rod to the second phalanx with the bolt of index 18 and the nut of index 19.
13. Attach the first lever arm on the small arm of the first phalanx with the bolt of index 25 and the nut of index 26. Make sure the rod is towards the back of the phalanx, that you use the bigger hole of the rod and that the curve is towards the outside of the finger.
14. Install a servomotor in each of the 4 servo holders for the palm (index 6). Use the fasteners 24 and make sure that it is installed so that viewed from the top of the servomotor, the wires go to the right.
15. Install the four assemblies made at step 19 on the palm with the fasteners of index 24. Make sure the arms of the servomotors are towards the thumb and that the wires are towards the base of the hand.
16. Install a servomotor on the palm at its spot near the thumb joint. Make sure the wires go towards the hand.
17. Install all the fingers except of the thumb on the palm, use the bolt of index 17 and the nut of index 19.
18. Install the thumb on the palm with the bolt of index 25 and the nut of index 26.
19. Install the lever arms of the fingers on the servomotors of the palm with the bolt of index 15 and the nut of index 16.
20. Install the motors drive on the back of the hand with the four bolts of index 23.
21. Make all the electric connections as explained in the electric README.
22. With three bolts of index 15, install a «+» shape servomotor arm on the base of the palm.
23. With the bolts of index 20, install the Arduino and the raspberry pi on the base of the arm.
24. Install the arm on the base with four bolts of index 20.
25. Install the last servo at the top of the arm with fasteners of index 24.
26. Pass all the wires of the hand inside the arm and make the connections as explained in the electric README.
27. Install the hand on the servomotor.
